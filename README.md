These are Excel files containing the x and y coordinates along with
the corresponding Spatial Dynamic Elastic Modulus on the plane of
isolated unit bricks. These modulus values were computed from the
Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) measurements were taken through the
thickness of the brick at specific points.
